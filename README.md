## 📋 Approach
1. I started with the **toggle theme-functionality**. I made sure that when a user clicks on the light/dark theme icon button, the background of the app changes to the right theme. Once I got this working, I moved on to defining the general stylings especially the colors used for both dark and light theme modes.
2. Using a mobile-first approach, I implemented each section of the web page one by one while ensuring each section is accessible and responsive across all major devices.
3. Started writing the functionality of getting the character count when the user starts typing in the text box in real-time.
